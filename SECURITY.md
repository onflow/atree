# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Flow was built from the ground up with security in mind. Our code, infrastructure, and development methodology helps us keep our users safe.

We really appreciate the community's help. Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities helps to maintain the security and privacy of everyone.

If you care about making a difference, please follow the guidelines below.

# **Guidelines For Responsible Disclosure**

We ask that all researchers adhere to these guidelines [here](https://flow.com/flow-responsible-disclosure).

Currently, Atree does not officially support 32-bit platforms. If a vulnerability requires compiling the software for a 32-bit platform, then it should only be reported if the affected software claims to support 32-bit platforms.

Please include the name and version of the tool that detected the issue (if applicable).  This can help us identify buggy or noisy vulnerability detectors, and identify duplicate reports more efficiently.
